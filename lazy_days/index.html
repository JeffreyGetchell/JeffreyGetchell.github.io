  <h3>By Susan Smith</h3>
  <img src="images/diner.jpg" alt="diner">
  <p>As my New's resolution in 2016,I vowed to never again make at home.

   and the food never seemed to measure up to the greasy food that is readily available at any old diner.</p>

   <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="beach">
 <p>Is your job taking too much time away from your rest and relaxation?
  Does your alegebra homework keep you up at night?
  I use to be in the same boat until I quit work and school and devoted myself to donig absolutely nothing.
  Many people think that laziness is a vice, but Iam here to tell you that it is an art.</p>
